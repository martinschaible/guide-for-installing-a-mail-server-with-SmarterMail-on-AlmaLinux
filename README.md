## Guide for installing a mail server with SmarterMail on AlmaLinux

This guide should allow you to install a mail server with **SmarterMail** on **AlmaLinux 10**. It also covers configuring **proxies** with nginx. As an anti-spam solution we use **Rspamd**.

Finally, migrating a SmarterMail server from Windows is also discussed.

:point_right: It makes sense to install the mail server exactly in the order of the articles.
