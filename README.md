## Guide for installing a mail server with SmarterMail on AlmaLinux

After more than **a decade** of SmarterMail on Windows, it's now goodbye Windows, hello Linux.

There are plenty of reasons to avoid Windows in the hosting business.
My reasons are:
* Update: If I want SSL 3.0, I have to buy a new version of Windows Server. The effort required for an in-place upgrade should not be underestimated.
* Updating Windows is annoying. It takes a long time and usually requires a reboot. Linux is significantly faster and easier with updates.
* Microsoft is also annoying.

This guide should allow you to install a mail server with **SmarterMail** on **AlmaLinux 10**. It also covers configuring **proxies** with nginx. As an anti-spam solution we use **Rspamd**.

Finally, migrating a SmarterMail server from Windows is also discussed.

* I hope that the guide is helpful and you benefit from it. Maybe you get some good ideas for running SmarterMail.
* This documentation supplements the SmarterTools manual and does not replace it.
